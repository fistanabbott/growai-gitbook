One notable example is the creation of female-only tournaments, which provide a platform for female gamers to showcase their skills. This has helped create role models for younger girls and aspiring gamers. The influence of these role models cannot be overstated, as they encourage participation and dedication among future generations.

## **2. Corporate Engagement and Support**
