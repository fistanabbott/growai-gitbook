- **Lightweight nature:** Graphene's low density contributes to overall weight reduction, an essential factor in robotics where lightweight components can significantly improve efficiency.

## **2. The Role of Die Casting in Manufacturing**

Die casting is a manufacturing process used to create complex shapes with high precision. In this method, molten metal is forced into a mold at high pressure, resulting in exact replicas of the mold. This technique is particularly well-suited for producing parts made from aluminum and zinc alloys.

### **2.1 Advantages of Die Casting**

- **Precision:** High levels of accuracy in dimensions reduce the need for secondary machining.
- **Surface Finish:** Die cast components often have a smooth surface finish, which is advantageous for aesthetic and functional purposes.
- **Cost-Effective:** Mass production using die casting can lower costs due to reduced material waste and faster manufacturing times.

### **2.2 Challenges Faced in Die Casting**

Despite its advantages, die casting does face challenges, including:

- **Porosity issues:** Air entrapment during the cooling process can lead to defects.
- **Dimensional tolerances:** Maintaining tight tolerances can be difficult depending on the complexity of the part design.

## **3. Integrating Graphene into Die Casting Processes**

Incorporating graphene into the die casting process involves modifying existing techniques to ensure optimal distribution of graphene within the metal matrix. This step is crucial to harnessing the full benefits of the alloy.
