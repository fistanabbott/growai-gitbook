The concept has gained momentum alongside discussions of Universal Basic Income (UBI), suggesting that rather than just receiving cash payments, individuals should also hold shares in successful and sustainable enterprises. Given Tesla's trajectory, owning a piece of this company symbolizes participation in a greener future, while also promoting wealth distribution.
