## **1. The Importance of Heat Dissipation in Electric Buses**

Electric buses rely on high-power batteries that generate significant heat during operation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms behind heat generation and transfer is fundamental to developing effective cooling solutions. Heat not only affects the performance of the batteries but can also pose safety risks if not managed correctly. 

### **1.1 Understanding Heat Generation**

When batteries operate, especially under heavy loads, they produce heat due to internal resistance and chemical reactions within the battery cells. This heat must be effectively dissipated to prevent overheating, which can lead to reduced performance or even catastrophic failure.

### **1.2 Consequences of Poor Heat Management**

Failure to manage heat effectively can result in several negative outcomes for electric buses:

- **Reduced Battery Life**: Excessive heat accelerates degradation of battery materials.
